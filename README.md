**Simplified Explanation of the Assignment Document:**

**Assignment Overview:**
1. **Objective:** Implement and analyze different dictionary data structures using Java.
2. **Dictionary Definition:** A collection of records, each with a unique key-value pair.

**Provided Materials:**
- Java source code files:
  - `ADTDictionary.java`: Dictionary interface
  - `ALDictionary.java`: Array-based dictionary implementation
  - `DictionaryJUnitTest.java`: JUnit 5 test case (optional)
  - `DictionaryManualTest.java`: Manual test program (optional)
  - Sample warehouse inventory data

**Tasks:**
1. **Task 1 (10 marks):** Implement a list-based dictionary.
2. **Task 2 (6 marks):** Perform asymptotic analysis (best, average, and worst case) for Task 1 methods.
3. **Task 3 (10 marks):** Implement a double list-based dictionary.
4. **Task 4 (6 marks):** Perform asymptotic analysis for Task 3 methods.
5. **Task 5 (40 marks):** Develop a WarehouseInventory database using the provided template and dictionary implementations. Implement functions to insert, remove, clear, find records, count inventories, and calculate total inventory value.

**Submission Instructions:**
- Combine all Java files and answer sheets into a single archive (ZIP, GZ, or TAR).
- Follow the specified naming convention.
- Submit by July 27, 23:59 through Moodle. Email submissions are not accepted.

**Note:**
- Ensure the project structure keeps all relevant files under one `src` folder.
